# 🏗️ GOTHWAD STORE — Updated Build Plan (14 Phases)

> **App Name:** Gothwad Store
> **Look:** EXACTLY like Google Play Store (2024 new UI)
> **Tabs (5):** Home | Apps | Search | Games | Profile
> **Top Bar Rule:**
>   - Home, Apps, Games, Profile → "Gothwad Store" title (bold, 20sp, #202124) + Profile avatar (32dp green circle, white "G") on right. NO search bar.
>   - Search tab → ONLY clean search bar (pill shape, grey bg, back arrow, text input, mic icon). No title, no avatar.
> **Data Source:** ONLY Aptoide API (https://ws75.aptoide.com/api/7/). No F-Droid, no backend, no Supabase, no Firebase.
> **Status:** Phase 1 & 2 already DONE. Continue from Phase 3.
